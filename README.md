# API Call using Combine Framework

Combine is a Swift framework for processing values over time. To make an API call using Combine, you typically use the URLSession to create a publisher that emits a sequence of data. Here's a simple example of making an API call using Combine:

In this example, the fetchPost function returns an AnyPublisher that emits a Post object or an error. The sink function is used to handle the result of the publisher, with separate closures for successful completion and failure.

Make sure to replace the Post struct and API endpoint URL with your own data model and API details. Additionally, consider handling any additional headers, query parameters, or authentication that your API requires.

Note: This example assumes you have a basic understanding of Combine and Codable in Swift. If you're not familiar with these concepts, you may want to explore them further in the Swift documentation or other resources.
